# MRDadaptis
## ABSTRACT
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Detection of structural variations (SV) through circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has become a key method for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD). But The heterogeneity of ctDNA samples, characterized by limits of detection (LOD) and diverse structural variant (SV) types, causes inter- and intra-sample detection performance fluctuations, posing significant challenges for stable MRD detecting. SV detection tools are equipped with multiple user-configurable parameters designed to accommodate this heterogeneity, but optimizing these parameters is difficult for users due to the combinatorial explosion of possible parameter combinations and the sheer volume heterogeneous sequencing data. To address this, we propose MRD-Adaptis, a novel SV detection tool that incorporates a self-adaptive mechanism, optimizing parameters based on features derived from ctDNA sequencing data. This method integrates a Bayesian optimization framework with a meta-learning approach to dynamically adjust parameters, effectively adapting to sample heterogeneity and overcoming the complexities of manual parameter tuning. Extensive validation experiments using both simulated and real-world ctDNA datasets demonstrated that MRD-Adaptis consistently delivered high detection performance, as evidenced by substantially improved average F1-scores compared to existing methods. Additionally, MRD-Adaptis exhibited superior stability across heterogeneous ctDNA regions, demonstrated by reduced variance, lower root means square error (RMSE), and increased kurtosis. These results highlight the significant advantages of our self-adaptive parameter optimization framework in addressing sample heterogeneity, underscoring its potential to improve the accuracy and consistency of MRD detecting through ctDNA analysis.

# Usage Guide

This guide explains the process of simulating data, training a meta-model, and testing models with recommended parameters using Python scripts and tools.

## Simulated Data Files Generation

Simulate fq data using **GSDcreator** by following the method described in the paper available on IEEE Xplore.

### Reference
[Simulation method for fq data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8983192)

## Requirements
- **Python version:** 2.7 (for simulation steps)
- **Python version:** 3.6 or higher (for further data processing and meta-model tasks)

## Generate Simulated Data

### Generate Simulation Scripts
Use `A_stableCallerPaperSimFlow.py` to generate `.sh` scripts for simulating 10,000 samples:

    python A_stableCallerPaperSimFlow.py

### Install GSDcreator and Run Simulations
1. Convert scripts to Unix format and make them executable:

    dos2unix 10000run.py
    chmod +x 10000run.py

2. Execute the simulation script (ensure Python 2.7 is installed):

    python 10000run.py

### step 3 Training a Meta-Model

Training a meta-model involves creating a model that learns from the outputs or performance of Bayesian models. The resulting meta-model is saved as `multi_target_regression_model.pth`.

To evaluate the model's generalization ability, we trained it on 400 simulated data samples and tested it using 176 real-world data samples. Additionally, 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training set to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.Use the following script to test different tools:
